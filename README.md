- [DLL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection) - This project needs DLL injection into _IGI_ game.</br>
- **Game specific section.**
- [IGI Graphs Structure](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Research-Data/blob/main/Research/GRAPH/Graph-Structure.txt) - Project IGI 1 Graph structure data.
- [IGI 3D Models](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Research-Data/blob/main/Research/Natives/IGI-Models.txt) - Project IGI uses 3D models in

## Editor components.
Editor has several components which it needs in order to work fully to its functionality.
- Server : Located at [OrgFree](http://igiresearchdevelopers.orgfree.com/) which contains Mission files and Resources like Weapon/A.I images for editor.
- ~~Database : Located at Github Gist private repo contains privacy information like _I.P,Mac Address_ and _Key_ for Editor.~~
- Internal DLL : Located at [IGI-Internals](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI_Internal) is used to call IGI Game internal native methods.
- QEditor - Located at path `C:\Users\my_username\AppData\Roaming\QEditor`  This is appdata file comes pre-installed with any version of editor and can be downloaded from here [QEditor Full Version](https://cutt.ly/p1ASiQX).</br>

## QEditor components.
**Q**Editor was the initial name of the project because editor actually modifies **Q** files of games like _QVM,QSC,QAS_ files but later it was changed.</br>

## Editor Working flow.
Editor most of the time just compiles the script file _QSC_ called _Q_ script source into _QVM_ called _Q_ virtual machine and Restart the level in order to see the affected changes. 
Here is workflow mentioned.
1. Get game level and select proper source file of level located at `QEditor\QFiles\IGI_QSC\missions\location0\level`.</br>
2. Updates the script file with new script depends upon logic Add/Update/Delete commands.</br>
**Internal compiler**</br>
3. Copies script file from Editor `C:\IGI-Editor` to `D:\IGI\` and compiles them to binary _QVM_ file and moves them to proper destination.</br>
**External compiler**</br>
3. Copies script file from Editor `C:\IGI-Editor` to `QEditor\QCompiler\Compile\input` and compiles them to binary _QVM_ file and convert compiled QVM v7 (IGI 2) to QVM v5 (IGI 1) using _DConv_ tool and moves them to proper destination.</br>
4. Restart the level and see the changes.</br>
